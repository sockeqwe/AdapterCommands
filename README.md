# AdapterCommands
Drop in solution to animate RecyclerView's dataset changes by using the `command pattern` for adapters with **not stable ids**.
Read my [blog post](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/adapter-commands) for more information.

Keep in mind that the runtime of `DiffCommandsCalculator` is `O(n*m)` (n = number of items in old list, m = number of items in new list).
So you better run this on a background thread if your data set contains many items.

##Dependencies

```groovy
compile 'com.hannesdorfmann.adaptercommands:adaptercommands:1.0.4'
```

## How to use
There are basically 2 components:
  - `DiffCommandsCalculator` that calculates the difference from previous data set to the new data set and returns `List<AdapterCommand>`. Please note that `DiffCommandsCalculator` is **not thread safe**. If you need a thread safe instance use `ThreadSafeDiffCommandsCalculator`.
  - `AdapterCommandProcessor` takes `List<AdapterCommand>` and executes each command to trigger RecyclerView's `ItemAnimator` to run animations.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

  @Bind(R.id.recyclerView) RecyclerView recyclerView;

  List<Item> items = new ArrayList<Item>();
  Random random = new Random();
  ItemAdapter adapter; // RecyclerView adapter
  AdapterCommandProcessor commandProcessor;
  DiffCommandsCalculator<Item> commandsCalculator = new DiffCommandsCalculator<Item>();

  @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);

    adapter = new ItemAdapter(this, items);
    recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
    recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new GridLayoutManager(this, 4));

    commandProcessor = new AdapterCommandProcessor(adapter);
  }

  // Called when new items should be displayed in RecyclerView
  public void setItems(List<Item> newItems){
    adapter.setItems(newItems);
    List<AdapterCommand> commands = commandsCalculator.diff(newItems);
    commandProcessor.execute(commands); // executes commands that triggers animations
  }
```

## MVP
Best practise is to use a `PresentationModel` and `Model-View-Presenter`. See  my [blog post](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/adapter-commands) for a concrete example.

## Customization
 - comparing items
 `DiffCommandsCalculator` uses standard java's `equals()` method to compare two items (one from old list, one from new list).
  So you have to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` in your model class (use IDE to generate that):
  ```java
public class Item {

  int id;
  String text;

  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

    Item item = (Item) o;

    return id == item.id;
  }

  @Override public int hashCode() {
    return id;
  }
 ```
 As you might have noticed, we only use `Item.id` for equals. The reason is that if we have this item in old list `item { id = 1, text ="Foo"}` and the same item with the same id in the new list `{item { id = 1, text ="other"}` we just want to compare this items by the id.
 What here has happened was that the `item.text` has been changed from new list to old list, but we still compare two items just by `item.id` since this is the property we use in `equals()`.

 However, when a `item.text` has been changed, we have to detect this too because we have to call `adapter.notifyItemChanged(position)` (`ItemChangedCommand`).
 So we can provide an `ItemChangedDetector` that we can pass as constructor argument to `DiffCommandsCalculator`:

 ```java
class MyItemChangedDetector implements ItemChangedDetector<Item>() {
    @Override public boolean hasChanged(Item oldItem, Item newItem) {
      return !oldItem.text.equals(newItem.text);
    }
};
 ```
 and then use it like this:
 ```java
DiffCommandsCalculator<Item> calculator = new DiffCommandsCalculator<>(new MyItemChangedDetector());
 ```

 - We also can specify what exactly should happen on the first time we use `DiffCommandsCalculator` (there is no old list to compare to).
 In this case we either could call `adapter.notifyDatasetChanged()` (`EntireDatasetChangedCommand`) which is the default behaviour or `adapter.notifyItemRangeInserted(0, items.size())` (`ItemRangeInsertedCommand`) which then will run `ItemAnimator` so that items will animate in.
 You can specify the behaviour as constructor parameter `DiffCommandsCalculator(boolean itemRangeInsertedOnFirstDiff)`: `new DiffCommandsCalculator(false)` uses `EntireDatasetChangedCommand` (no animations, equivalent to `new DiffCommandsCalculator()`) whereas `new DiffCommandsCalculator(true)` uses `ItemRangeInsertedCommand` (animations).
